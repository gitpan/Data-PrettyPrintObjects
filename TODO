Add support for path specific directions:
  objs -> PATH -> OBJ_OPTIONS
support objects:
  $VAR->foo->[0]
  $VAR->foo->[*]


Add support for different scalar print methods including:
   type   : SCALAR
   trunc  : this is a long ...
trunc takes a long (possibly multi-line) scalar and prints it as no more than one line
with ... at the end


Add list_format=compact
   list = [ a, b, c ]
but it will only apply to lists simple (1-line) scalars or objects treated as
scalars (and can apply if max_depth ends here)
